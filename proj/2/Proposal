Encrypted Computer To Computer Communication Program

I am going to set up a computer to computer application that will securely communicate between the
two devices. This program will have certain milestones, such as first setting up communications
between two devices, then having the communications work simultaneously using threads, and finally
encrypting the communications so only devices with the proper key would be able to communicate. This
will be useful for me in the future to help understand how computer to computer communications work
and will help me understand how encrypting their communications works.
